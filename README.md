## Project Overview

### Problem
Preparing for technical interviews can be overwhelming. While platforms like LeetCode, Grind75, LinkedIn, and others provide helpful resources, they often fall short in delivering:
- Free, accessible, and relevant company-tagged problems.
- Reliable and timely alumni connections for personalized advice and mock interviews.
- Comprehensive company insights specific to the Australian market.

### Solution
**HireVerse** addresses these challenges by offering:
- A personalized LeetCode problem list based on target companies, preparation time, and interview dates.
- An *Alumni Connect* feature that allows students to connect with UNSW alumni for advice, insights, and mock interviews.
- Detailed company overviews with tech stacks, recruiter contacts, perks, and alumni connections â€” all for free!

## Features
- **Dynamic LeetCode Problem List**  
  Personalized problem sets based on target company and interview date, with problems tagged by UNSW alumni.
  
- **Alumni Connect**  
  Alumni can voluntarily sign up to provide advice and mock interviews, with options to show/hide Calendly links and email addresses.

- **Company Overviews**  
  In-depth insights on tech stacks, perks, recruiter lists, and alumni connections specific to the Australian market.
